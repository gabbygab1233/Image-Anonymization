# Face Anonymization

Data anonymization refers to an irreversible transformation of data to prevent the identification of a particular individual. On social media and photo-sharing sites, a large number of face photographs are shared and distributed every day. Some facial photos, such as those on user profile pages, are connected to a person's name, whereas others are anonymized for privacy reasons. The privacy of a named person is violated when an anonymized face image is linked to them. One way to overcome this privacy problem is to anonymize face images to protect the identity of someone.
